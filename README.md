# CoinTossGame
A solidity smart contract for coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails.

Secure Randomness: Chainlink VRF is used to ensure that the source of randomness is secure and verifiable, preventing manipulation.

Efficient Payouts: The bets are settled in a loop, but now there's a check to ensure only when randomness is fulfilled. This pattern ensures no external interaction during randomness retrieval.

Managing LINK tokens: The contract checks for sufficient LINK balance before accepting bets and provides a function for the owner to withdraw LINK.

Withdrawal functions: Separate functions for withdrawing ETH and LINK to manage different assets clearly.
State management: Using a requestInProgress flag to prevent reentrancy and ensure that only one randomness  request.
